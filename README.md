## What is Sendly?
>>>>>>> bfc9d63d400d5a9328afa97e6bb9f797e3e6cdee

Sendly makes it easy to unlock stablecoins for any person, even if they don't have a critical wallet yet. 

The main idea is to send tokens via the username of the most popular social networks: X, Telegram, Instagram, Tiktok, etc.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The agent part of the platform is based on the orchestration of Langraph and Telegram bot. It is possible to send funds using voice commands, check the balance, and plan your expenses through the planner.

## Features
- NFT gift cards with custom messages, time locks, passwords, and AI-generated artwork.
- Voice Payment Agent that converts spoken commands into on-chain gift cards using ElevenLabs and AIML API.
- Social recipients via dedicated vaults for Twitter, Twitch, Telegram, TikTok, Instagram, or direct wallet addresses.
- Internal wallet management backed by Circle APIs.
- Contact manager that syncs personal and Privy-sourced social contacts, favorites, and wallet metadata.
- Spend flow with passcode, timer, and ownership checks before redemption.
- Transaction analytics with sent/received history, cache layer, and CSV export.
- Circle BridgeKit integration to move USDC/EURC between Arc Testnet, Base Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, and other configured chains.
